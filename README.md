# Week1-HW
UNCC Homework

### Homework Overview

HTML

* First, I broke up the code so it was easier to read.
* Next, I removed all of the Divs from the HTML and replaced them with semantic code.
* Afterward, I added alt tags to the pictures and icons and added title tags to the nav bar.
* Then, I mapped out the classes

CSS

* First, I found all of the CSS that repeated itself.
* Next, I consolidated repeating code by changing the class names for several different sections. I took care to not remove additional elements attached to each class, like img or h1, etc.
* During each consolidated section I took care to repeatedly check the website to make sure nothing was broken in the code.

### Git-push

A first, I had a hard time pushing the code but eventually, with some trial and error, I was able to successfully push the code to github!
